The Fractional Knapsack Problem and the 0/1 Knapsack Problem are two variants of the knapsack problem, but they have distinct characteristics.

1] Fractional Knapsack Problem:

In the Fractional Knapsack Problem, items can be broken down into fractions. That means you are allowed to take a fraction of an item, and the objective is to maximize the total value in the knapsack while respecting the weight constraint.
This problem is solved using a greedy strategy, where items are selected based on their value-to-weight ratio in descending order. The algorithm takes fractions of items if needed to fill the knapsack optimally.
The time complexity of the greedy algorithm for fractional knapsack is O(n log n), where n is the number of items, due to the sorting step.

2] 0/1 Knapsack Problem:

In the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, items cannot be divided. You either include the whole item in the knapsack, or you exclude it entirely.
This problem is typically solved using dynamic programming. The dynamic programming approach involves constructing a table where the entry at each cell represents the maximum value that can be obtained with a certain weight capacity and a certain subset of items.
The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution for the 0/1 knapsack problem is O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
